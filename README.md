# Urban_Mobility_Analysis of Hyderabad (1990 - 2025)

This project analyzes **synthetic data** on Hyderabad’s transport usage, CO₂ emissions, commute times, and accident rates between 1990 and 2025.  
It also predicts future trends (2026–2030) using **Linear Regression** models.  

The goal is to demonstrate **data visualization, analysis, and forecasting skills** using Python.

---

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Google Colab** (for development environment)
- **Python** (programming language)
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas` (data cleaning and manipulation)
  - `NumPy` (numerical operations)
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` (data visualization)
  - `scikit-learn` (Linear Regression for forecasting)

---

## 📊 Key Features
- Trends in transport usage (bus, train, metro, cars, etc.)
- Environmental impact (CO₂ emissions, per capita emissions)
- Safety analysis (accidents per 100k people)
- Forecasting future transport demand and emissions (2026–2030)

## 📁 Project Structure
- `Hyderabad_Transport_Analysis.ipynb` → Main Colab notebook with code, plots, and analysis  
- `synthetic_hyderabad_transport.csv` → Dataset (synthetic, created for learning purposes)  
- `requirements.txt` → List of Python libraries used (optional)

---

## 📝 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.  
2. Upload the dataset (if not already included).  
3. Run cells step by step to reproduce analysis and plots.  

---

## 📌 Notes
- The dataset used here is **synthetic** and created for educational purposes.  
- Predictions are illustrative and **not based on real transport data**.  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Integrating real datasets from government/open data portals.  
- Comparing Hyderabad with other cities.  
- Using advanced forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTMs).
